# Placeholder Image Fix

## Problem
The placeholder.jpg doesn't exist on production server, causing 404 errors and infinite loops.

## Solution Applied
✅ **External Placeholder Service**: Using `https://via.placeholder.com/` for reliable placeholders
✅ **Loop Prevention**: Added `e.target.onerror = null;` to prevent infinite error loops
✅ **Consistent Fallback**: All image errors now show the same placeholder

## Changes Made

### Frontend (Menu.jsx)
- Replaced backend placeholder with external service
- Added loop prevention in onError handler

### Admin Panel (ListItems.jsx)  
- Fixed image display in both view and edit modes
- Added reliable fallback for missing images

## Benefits
- ✅ No more 404 errors for placeholder
- ✅ No infinite loading loops
- ✅ Consistent image fallback across all devices
- ✅ Works immediately without backend changes

## Test Results
- Images load properly or show "No Image" placeholder
- No console errors or network loops
- Admin panel displays images correctly
- User frontend shows proper fallbacks

The image loading issue is now completely resolved!
